      Hi, I'm Godwin!, a junior frontend developer with a love for creating responsive and
      very user friendly web applications. My birthday is on the 25<sup>th</sup> of May.
      I am an extremely boring person who spends most of my days working,
      but in my free time, you'll find me playing video games lmao.
